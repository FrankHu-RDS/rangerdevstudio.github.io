If everything goes right on the authorization you should see your calendars as displayed below:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-498" src="https://i1.wp.com/doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/82.png?resize=671%2C573" alt="" width="671" height="573" srcset="https://doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/82.png 671w, https://doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/82-300x256.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" data-recalc-dims="1">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you don’t see your calendars it means that your hosting is not allowing BUP to connect to your Google API.
<strong>Please note:</strong> If you don’t set a calendar, the primary calendar will be used as default and you will see your appointments in your main calendar.
 
<h4>Allowing Staff Members To connect Their Google Calendars.</h4>
<strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> THIS IS AVAILABLE ONLY ON PROFESSIONAL AND ULTIMATE VERSIONS ONLY.
If you’re running either Professional or Ultimate the Staff member has access to a Backend. If you want to let your staff members to connect to Google Calendar you have to add an additional redirect URI.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-452" src="https://i2.wp.com/doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-1.png?resize=698%2C612" alt="" width="698" height="612" srcset="https://doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-1.png 698w, https://doc.bookingultrapro.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-1-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" data-recalc-dims="1">
 
Please make sure that the second Authorized URI matches the user’s account URL in your website. This point is very important, otherwise the authorization will fail.

With stores closing, and social distancing measures in place, doing physical business is not a viable option anymore. Even popular entrepeneur Gary Vaynerchuck has written an article about why every store needs to be doing &#8220;e-commerce&#8221; (an online ordering platform). You can   learn more about that here : <a href="https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/why-companies-need-to-lean-into-e-commerce-now-more-than-ever/">https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/why-companies-need-to-lean-into-e-commerce-now-more-than-ever/</a></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re offering a free online store platform for you and your business for three months free. We will build out an online store that can handle delivery via Post-mates so that you can keep your business going.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>In the world today there are so many consumers looking for different ways to get food. The market is saturated with different apps(GrubHub, UberEats, DoorDash), online grocery solutions (prime fresh, pantry, postmates), and premixed grocery kits (freshly, Blue Apron, and Sun Basket) all taking a percentage of an already slim profit margin that restaurants have to deal with. Why let these food solutions take 15-40% of the revenue from your sale? You can get online with your own website and make your own sales with a platform that not only promotes your brand and offers a way to connect with your customers, but also be able to save your money with no commission online ordering! Below are some reasons why you need to ditch those apps and start building your business a website today.</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t Pay Commissions On Your Orders</strong></h2>



<p>In today’s current technology landscape there are so many options for a restaurant to accept online ordering. Why does it makes sense to pay Grubhub, Ubereat, Slice or any other ordering platforms a commission just to process your pickup orders. This is especially hard on restaurants because when you consider that they now charging a whopping 30% fee on each online order! The restaurant industry is already incredibly competitive and then account for the 30% fees just to offer customers online ordering, makes it virtually impossible for most restaurants to stay afloat!</p>



<h2><strong>You Can’t Build A Brand on Somebody Else’s Platform</strong></h2>



<p>Your business is a brand. Your brand is fragile something that takes time to build and cultivate this is something all good business owners understand. Therefore why would you want to put your brand on a list of your competitors to be another row on Grubhub or Ubereats. Your business can not personalize itself or stand out from the crowd, and instead your just another entry on page 7 of GrubHub. You don&#8217;t build a brand using a 3rd party food service.</p>



<h2><strong>You Can’t Market Directly to Your Customers on Ordering Platforms</strong></h2>



<p>On Grubhub, UberEats or any other ordering platform these applications do not allow you to market directly to your customers. This is because your customers data is owned and controlled by Grubhub. These ordering platforms don’t provide you any way to send emails, subscriptions, letters, promos, or specials that you may be running. With a website from RDS, we can provide you many ways to leverage your customer’s emails and subscription information. From there we can send them marketing emails about your latest special, new promotions you are running, or even new offerings on your menu. We can also help arrange customer loyalty and rewards programs on your website so you can give your customers an incentive to return and visit. With a site from RDS you are in full control of your marketing and building a relationship with your customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>You Can&#8217;t Get Paid (Or Atleast It&#8217;s Very Slow)</strong></h2>



<p>With a service like Grubhub you are forced to receive payout for your orders at the end of every week. On your own website you are free to use whatever payment processing service you like Paypal, Stripe etc. With Paypal payment processing you can have your funds transferred straight to your bank at the end of each day.</p>



<h2><strong>Websites are Tax Breaks, Grubhub is Not</strong></h2>



<p>The added benefit of having your own business website, is that the total cost of having the site developed and to host your site are tax deductible. With a site from us you will be able to deduct that monthly subscription cost from your taxes each year for your business.
